SphereQuest 1.5 was created as a final project for Computer Graphics
(SFWR ENG 3GC3) at McMaster University in 2011.

The original SphereQuest was created as a group project with Ben Kybartas
(bkybartas at gmail dot com) and Jason Costabile (constabile at gmail dot com)
in 2010. The original source code can be found in a Google Code repository:
http://code.google.com/p/spherequest/

SphereQuest is a simple, quirky game in which you must roll your sphere through
a maze, locate the Wise Men, and answer their riddle correctly. You must locate
the Wise Man in 5 different levels to win.

Answering a question incorrectly will cause you to lose a certian amount of "zen"
depending on the chosen difficulty. Reaching 0% zen results in a game over. There
are fountains hidden on each level which can restore your zen.

To move the sphere, press the arrow keys. Pressing the ESC key will quit the game.

The game can be saved and loaded by right-clicking anywhere on the game screen and following the prompt.

There are also several cheats/development tools which can be toggled by pressing the following keyboard keys:
J: Draws grid lines
F4: Skips to the next level
F5: Automatically wins the game
F6: Automatically loses the game
P: Prints the current sphere coordinates to the console window (if available)
